Cube Game (?)

I'm using this repo as a bit of a playground for three.js, and for thinking in three dimensions.

Currently, the game just consists of repeatedly seeking out the goal, using wasd for movement.  Once the goal is reached, any key will reset.  Traps require answering trivia, and failing a trap resets the player.

Goals/Ideas

- [ ] Reveal larger area around player (?)
- [ ] More interesting terrain/player models
- [ ] Signal correct/incorrect
- [ ] Better traps (allow choosing trivia category, maybe more than one question)
- [ ] Lives/damage system
- [ ] Better looking trivia bit (consider 3d text?)
- [ ] add walls
- [ ] smoother animations somehow?
- [x] camera follows player (+ camera controls?)
- [x] Movement animation (probably with pauses)
- [x] More traps
- [x] Figure out Three fonts
- [x] Generate traps for player (trivia type thing)
- [x] Cube material based on proximity to goal
- [x] Score counter (reaching goal/trivia answers)
- [x] Change goal generation to exclude super low values (generation at origin probably soft locks)
