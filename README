Cube Game (?)

I'm using this repo as a bit of a playground for three.js, and for thinking in three dimensions.

Currently, the game just consists of repeatedly seeking out the goal, using wasd for movement.  Once the goal is reached, any key will reset.

Goals/Ideas

- [ ] Generate traps for player (trivia type thing? Language practice, maybe?)
- [ ] Reveal larger area around player (?)
- [x] Cube material based on proximity to goal
- [ ] Score counter (reaching goal/trivia answers)
- [x] Change goal generation to exclude super low values (generation at origin probably soft locks)
- [ ] Movement animation (probably with pauses)
